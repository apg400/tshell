# TShell

## Overview
This shell has many of the features found in a standard bash shell, however, it is limited to executable commands found in the bin. It can run all executable commands as well as support these operators: '&&', '||', and ';'. Parenthesis can be used to establish operator precendence. In addition to this is, it also supports the I/O redirection operators '>>', '>', '<', and '|'. There are some bugs with the I/O operators that still need to be fixed. And quotation marks are also not supported at the moment.
